### Project: Expense Expert

Expense Expert - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.

  - What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  - Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  - Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

  - Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
  - Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  - Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

- **Tools**:
  - Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
  - Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo
